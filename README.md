## 🔑 Basic Keylogger

- This program records and logs every key you press on your keyboard.
- It saves all keystrokes to a file named `keylog.txt` in the same folder.
- The program runs in the background and safely exits when you press the **ESC** key.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. Uses the `pynput` library to listen to keyboard events.
2. Normal characters (letters, numbers) are written directly.
3. Special keys (like `Enter`, `Space`) are written inside `[brackets]`.
4. Pressing **ESC** stops the keylogger and closes the program.
